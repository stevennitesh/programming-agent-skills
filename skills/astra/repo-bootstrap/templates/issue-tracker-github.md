# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specifications live in GitHub Issues for this repository's configured
project. Use this guide for tracker-backed work.

## Configuration

**PRs as a request surface:** no.

**Close implemented items:** yes.

**Parent / child mode:** native-sub-issues.

**Dependency mode:** native-dependencies.

## Operations

Resolve the exact project and target type before acting. Prefer an available
GitHub connector; otherwise use the installed CLI or documented API. Check
current operation support and a read-back method before mutation.

Read the issue body, comments, labels, state, assignee, and relevant relationships.
Publish, comment, label, claim, or close only within the authorized task. The
configured closure policy applies when the consuming workflow has established
completion. It does not start work or authorize closure by itself.

## Representation

- Content lives in issue bodies and comments.
- Category and state use [the label mapping](triage-labels.md).
- Parent, child, and blocking links use the configured native relationships.
- An active claim uses the assignee when the workflow requires claiming.

Preserve the relationship representation during an operation. A closed blocker
does not establish readiness if other dependencies remain unresolved.

## Mutation read-back

Refetch the target and affected relationships after a mutation and verify the
fields that changed. After an uncertain result, inspect actual state before
retrying to avoid duplicate issues, comments, or other effects. Report any
partial result and remaining gap.
